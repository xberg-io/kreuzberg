# kreuzberg-libheif

Safe Rust bindings around `libheif-sys` for decoding HEIF / HEIC / AVIF
containers — vendored into Kreuzberg from the original
[libheif-rs](https://github.com/Cykooz/libheif-rs) by
[Kirill Kuzminykh (Cykooz)](https://github.com/Cykooz).

Vendored at upstream version **v2.7.0** (MIT-licensed). The vendored copy
preserves the upstream MIT license; see `LICENSE`. See `ATTRIBUTIONS.md`
at the repo root for full attribution details.

This crate exists so Kreuzberg can pin, patch, and stabilise the HEIF
decoder surface against the rest of the workspace. We continue to depend
on upstream `libheif-sys` from crates.io for the underlying C bindings.

## Modifications from upstream

- Workspace dependency alignment (`libc`, `image` pinned via workspace).
- Pinned to Rust edition 2021 (matches upstream); the rest of the workspace is
  edition 2024 but this crate keeps the upstream pattern because libheif-rs
  uses unwrapped unsafe operations inside `unsafe fn`, which is a hard error
  under edition 2024.
- Workspace lints applied via `[lints] workspace = true`.
- Trimmed README to focus on the Kreuzberg use case.

The public API is unchanged from upstream `libheif-rs` v2.7.0.

## System requirements

`libheif` (the C library) must be installed at build and runtime, with
HEVC and AV1 codec backends (`libde265`, `libaom`):

- **macOS**: `brew install libheif`
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `apt install libheif-dev`
- **Fedora**: `dnf install libheif-devel`

Alternatively, enable the `embedded-libheif` feature to statically build
libheif from source (you still need `libde265` and `libaom` available on
the system).

## License

MIT, per upstream.
