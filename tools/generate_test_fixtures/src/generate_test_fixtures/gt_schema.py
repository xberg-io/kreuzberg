"""Ground-truth sidecar schema.

Every binary fixture produced by this toolkit ships with a JSON sidecar of
the same stem (``foo.docx`` -> ``foo.gt.json``). Integration tests load the
pair and assert ``ExtractionResult`` / ``ExtractionDiff`` fields against the
``expectations`` dict.

The schema is intentionally feature-shaped rather than format-shaped: a
``revisions`` fixture's expectations look the same whether the underlying
file is DOCX, ODT, XLSX, or PPTX. This keeps the integration-test asserter
generic.
